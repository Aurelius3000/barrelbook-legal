            <p>We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties.<br>

                <li><b>AI Processing:</b> Photos sent for AI extraction are retained for â‰¤30 days for quality assurance and never used for training.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>7. Security</h2>
            <p>We protect your data using industry-standard encryption:</p>
