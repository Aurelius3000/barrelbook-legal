This Privacy Policy explains how BarrelBook ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and protects your personal information when you use our mobile app ("the App").

By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## 2. Information We Collect

- **Account Information:** Email address, password, display name, age verification.
- **Bottle Data:** Information you add or confirm about bottles (brand, release, proof, price, fill level, notes, etc.).
- **Photos & Media:** Images you capture or upload of bottles.

### Information We Collect Automatically

- **Device Information:** Device type, operating system, app version.
- **Usage Data:** Features used, frequency of scans, interactions with catalog.
- **Log Data:** Crash reports, error logs, performance metrics.

### Information from Third Parties

- **AI Services:** Photos you submit for scanning may be temporarily processed by AI services (e.g., OpenAI) to extract data. Images and metadata are not retained beyond processing.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use your information to:

- Provide and improve the App’s features (cataloging, scanning, valuation).
- Sync your bottle data and images across devices.
- Support offline use with background upload when online.
- Enable you to share selected bottles or collections with friends you choose.
- Send important notices, such as security updates or Terms changes.

## 4. Sharing & Visibility

### Private by Default

Your catalog, photos, and notes are private to your account unless you choose to share them.

### Friend Sharing

If you share bottles or collections with friends, those users will be able to view the shared photos, data, and notes.

We cannot prevent recipients from saving, copying, or redistributing your shared content outside the App.

### No Public Posting

BarrelBook does not make your catalog or photos publicly visible on the internet. Sharing is limited to the friends you select.

### Third Parties

We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties.

Limited third-party services (e.g., AI providers, Firebase) process data to deliver features. These providers are contractually bound to protect your information.

## 5. Your Rights & Choices

- **Access & Correction:** You can view and edit your account information and catalog entries at any time.
- **Deletion:** You may delete your account through the App, which will remove your personal information after a reasonable retention period.
- **Sharing Controls:** You choose whether to share bottles or collections and with whom.

## 6. Data Retention

- **Bottle Photos & Data:** Stored as long as your account is active.
- **Shared Content:** Remains accessible to friends you shared with unless you delete it or revoke access.
- **AI Processing:** Photos sent for AI extraction are retained for ≤30 days for quality assurance and never used for training.

## 7. Security

We protect your data using industry-standard encryption:

- **In Transit:** TLS 1.3
- **At Rest:** AES-256
- **Storage:** Data and images stored in U.S.-based regions only.

However, no system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection.

## 8. Children’s Privacy

The App is not intended for anyone under the legal drinking age in their jurisdiction. We do not knowingly collect information from underage users.

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If material changes are made, we will notify you through:
